# React Native FlatList Rendering Error: Index Out of Range

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native throws an 'Index out of range' error intermittently when fetching data from an API. The error is difficult to consistently reproduce, making debugging challenging. 

## Problem Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API.  Under normal circumstances, the FlatList should render the fetched data without issue. However, occasionally, the app crashes with an 'Index out of range' error within the FlatList's `renderItem` function.  This seems to be related to timing or asynchronous operations, but the exact cause is elusive.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the `item` data exists before accessing its properties within the `renderItem` method.
